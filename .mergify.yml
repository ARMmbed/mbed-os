# Mergify follow our workflow: https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/contributing/workflow.html
# Inital state (needs: review) is done by internal reviewer bot

# Notes: conditions do not check if label is already there if we add or remove later, this is to limit Github API access to
# minimum. If a label is already there and we add it again, nothing should happen (we do 1 less access to Github).
# For instance for needs: work if CI failed, we just add a label as action, don't check if needs: works is already there.
#
# Reviewers request needs write access to block PR, otherwise it's just a suggestion on Github, not PR block
