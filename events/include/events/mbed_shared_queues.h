 * Return a pointer to an EventQueue, on which normal tasks can be queued.
 *
 * All calls to this return the same EventQueue - it and its dispatch thread
 * are created on the first call to this function. The dispatch thread
 * runs at default priority (currently osPriorityNormal).
 *
 * The EventQueue returned may be used to call() Events, or to chain() other
 * EventQueues so that they are run in the same context.
 *
 * Events (or chained EventQueues) executing on the normal event queue should
 * normally take less than 10ms to execute, to avoid starving other users. As
 * such, users can expect that event latency will typically be 10ms or less,
 * but could occasionally be significantly higher if many events are queued.
 *
 * If an RTOS is not present or the configuration option
 * `events.shared-dispatch-from-application` is set to true, then this
 * does not create a dedicated dispatch thread - instead the application is
 * expected to run the EventQueue's dispatch, for example from main. This is
 * necessary for the event loop to work without an RTOS, or an RTOS system can
 * save memory by reusing the main stack.
 *
 * @note
 * mbed_event_queue is not itself IRQ safe. To use the mbed_event_queue in
 * interrupt context, you must first call `mbed_event_queue()` in threaded
 * context and store the pointer for later use.
