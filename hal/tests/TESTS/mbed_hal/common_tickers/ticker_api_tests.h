 * We have the following assumption for the timer clock frequency:
 *
 * NOTE:
 * high freq ticker: 250 KHz (1 tick per 4 us) - 8 Mhz (1 tick per 1/8 us)
 * low power ticker: 8 KHz (1 tick per 125 us) - 64 KHz (1 tick per ~15.6 us)
 *
 * Lowest CPU speed is 16 MHz (1 tick per 1/16 us).
 *
 * For the boards with ticker clock freq less than or equal to 250 KHz we will try to prove that ticker is incremented by one
 * straightforward by reading ticker count value in the loop in order to detect a single ticker value update (hopefully by one).
 * For faster tickers we need to prove this indirectly using additional count_ticks() function which returns number of
 * ticks needed to perform N cycles of the empty while loop. For the same number of cycles function result should be the same with
 * accuracy +/- 1 tick. After the first test we will call count_ticks again with number of cycles equal N, N+1, N+2, ...
 * until we get other ticks result.
 *
 * Given ticker is available.
 * When ticker is initialised.
 * Then ticker counter is incremented by one.
