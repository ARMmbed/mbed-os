* The mbed lpc1768 does not support the deepsleep mode

* As mentionned in an application note from NXP:
*
*       http://www.po-star.com/public/uploads/20120319123122_141.pdf
*
*       {{{
*       The user should be aware of certain limitations during debugging.
*       The most important is that, due to limitations of the Cortex-M3
*       integration, the LPC17xx cannot wake up in the usual manner from
*       Deep Sleep and Power-down modes. It is recommended not to use these
*       modes during debug. Once an application is downloaded via JTAG/SWD
*       interface, the USB to SWD/JTAG debug adapter (Keil ULINK2 for example)
*       should be removed from the target board, and thereafter, power cycle
*       the LPC17xx to allow wake-up from deep sleep and power-down modes
*       }}}
*
*       As the interface firmware does not reset the target when a
*       mbed_interface_disconnect() semihosting call is made, the
*       core cannot wake-up from deepsleep.
*
*       We treat a deepsleep() as a normal sleep().
