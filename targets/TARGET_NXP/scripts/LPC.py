32.3.1.1 Criterion for Valid User Code
The reserved Cortex-M3 exception vector location 7 (offset 0x1C in the vector table)
should contain the 2's complement of the check-sum of table entries 0 through 6. This
causes the checksum of the first 8 table entries to be 0. The boot loader code checksums
the first 8 locations in sector 0 of the flash. If the result is 0, then execution control is
transferred to the user code.
