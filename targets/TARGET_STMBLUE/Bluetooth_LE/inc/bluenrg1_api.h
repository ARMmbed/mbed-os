If notifications (or indications) are enabled on that characteristic,

the function will return BLE_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES. This will happen 
if notifications (or indications) are enabled and the application calls 
@ref aci_gatt_update_char_value at an higher rate than what is allowed by the link.

parameters (decided by the master, see aci_l2cap_connection_parameter_update_request() 
for more info on how to suggest new connection parameters from a slave). If the 
application does not want to lose notifications because BlueNRG buffer becomes full, 
it has to retry again till the function returns BLE_STATUS_SUCCESS or any other error code.
