The meaning of the Encryption_Enabled parameter depends on whether the
Host has indicated support for Secure Connections in the Secure_Connections_Host_Support
parameter. When Secure_Connections_Host_Support is
'disabled' or the Connection_Handle refers to an LE link, the Controller shall
only use Encryption_Enabled values 0x00 (OFF) and 0x01 (ON).
