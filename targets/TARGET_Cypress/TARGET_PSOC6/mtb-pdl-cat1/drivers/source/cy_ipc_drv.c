* The function also has a way to specify through a parameter which IPC
* interrupts must be notified during the release event.
*
* \param base
* This parameter is a handle that represents the base address of the registers
* of the IPC channel.
* The parameter is generally returned from a call to the \ref
* Cy_IPC_Drv_GetIpcBaseAddress.
*
* \param releaseEventIntr
* Bit encoded list of IPC interrupt lines that are triggered by a release event.
*
* \return   Status of the operation
*   \retval CY_IPC_DRV_SUCCESS: The function executed successfully and the IPC channel
*                       was released.
*   \retval CY_IPC_DRV_ERROR: The IPC channel was not acquired before the
*                       function call.
