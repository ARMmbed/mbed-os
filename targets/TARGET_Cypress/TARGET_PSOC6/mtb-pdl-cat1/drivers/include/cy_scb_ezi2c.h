* Driver API for EZI2C Slave Peripheral
*
* The functions and other declarations used in this part of the driver are in
* cy_scb_ezi2c.h. You can also include cy_pdl.h to get access
* to all functions and declarations in the PDL.
*
* I2C - The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus is an industry-standard.
*
* The EZI2C slave peripheral driver provides an API to implement the I2C slave
* device based on the SCB hardware block. This slave device emulates a common
* I2C EEPROM interface that acts like dual-port memory between the external
* master and your code. I2C devices based on the SCB hardware are compatible
* with the I2C Standard mode, Fast mode, and Fast mode Plus specifications, as
* defined in the I2C bus specification.
* 
* EZI2C slave is a special implementation of the I2C that handles all communication
* between the master and slave through ISR (interrupt service routine) and requires
* no interaction with the main program flow from the slave side. The EZI2C should be
* used when a shared memory model between the I2C master and I2C slave is needed.
*
* Features:
* * An industry-standard I2C bus interface
* * Supports standard data rates of 100/400/1000 kbps
* * Emulates a common I2C EEPROM Interface
* * Acts like dual-port memory between the external master and your code
* * Supports Hardware Address Match
* * Supports two hardware addresses with separate buffers
* * On deep sleep-capable SCB, it supports wake from deep sleep on address match
* * Simple to set up and use; does not require calling EZI2C API
*   at run time.
*
********************************************************************************
* \section group_scb_ezi2c_configuration Configuration Considerations
********************************************************************************
* The EZI2C slave driver configuration can be divided to number of sequential
* steps listed below:
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_config
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_pins
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_clock
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_data_rate
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_intr
* * \ref group_scb_ezi2c_enable
*
* \note
* EZI2C slave driver is built on top of the SCB hardware block. The SCB3
* instance is used as an example for all code snippets. Modify the code to
* match your design.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_config Configure EZI2C slave
********************************************************************************
* To set up the EZI2C slave driver, provide the configuration parameters in the
* \ref cy_stc_scb_ezi2c_config_t structure. The primary slave address
* slaveAddress1 must be provided. The other parameters are optional for
* operation. To initialize the driver, call \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_Init
* function providing a pointer to the populated \ref cy_stc_scb_ezi2c_config_t
* structure and the allocated \ref cy_stc_scb_ezi2c_context_t structure.
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_CFG
*
* Set up the EZI2C slave buffer before enabling its
* operation by using \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_SetBuffer1 for the primary slave address
* and \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_SetBuffer2 for the secondary (if the secondary is enabled).
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_CFG_BUFFER
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_pins Assign and Configure Pins
********************************************************************************
* Only dedicated SCB pins can be used for I2C operation. The HSIOM
* register must be configured to connect dedicated SCB I2C pins to the
* SCB block. Also the I2C pins must be configured in Open-Drain, Drives Low mode
* (this pin configuration implies usage of external pull-up resistors):
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_CFG_PINS
*
* \note
* The alternative pins configuration is Resistive Pull-ups which implies usage
* internal pull-up resistors. This configuration is not recommended because
* resistor value is fixed and cannot be used for all supported data rates.
* Refer to device datasheet parameter RPULLUP for resistor value specifications.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_clock Assign Clock Divider
********************************************************************************
* A clock source must be connected to the SCB block to oversample input and
* output signals, in this document this clock will be referred as clk_scb.
* You must use one of the 8-bit or 16-bit dividers. Use the \ref group_sysclk
* driver API to do this.
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_CFG_ASSIGN_CLOCK
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_data_rate Configure Data Rate
********************************************************************************
* To get EZI2C slave to operate at the desired data rate, the clk_scb must be
* fast enough to provide sufficient oversampling. Use the
* \ref group_sysclk driver API to do this.
*
* <b>Refer to the technical reference manual (TRM) section I2C sub-section
* Oversampling and Bit Rate to get information about how to configure the
* I2C to run at the desired data rate</b>.
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_CFG_DATA_RATE
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_intr Configure Interrupt
********************************************************************************
* The interrupt is mandatory for the EZI2C slave operation.
* The \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_Interrupt function must be called in the interrupt
* handler for the selected SCB instance. Also, this interrupt must be enabled
* in the NVIC or it will not work.
*
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_INTR_A
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_INTR_B
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_enable Enable EZI2C slave
********************************************************************************
* Finally, enable the EZI2C slave operation by calling \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_Enable.
* Now the I2C device responds to the assigned address.
* \snippet scb/ezi2c_snippet/main.c EZI2C_ENABLE
*
********************************************************************************
* \section group_scb_ezi2c_use_cases Common Use Cases
********************************************************************************
* The EZI2C slave operation might not require calling any EZI2C slave function
* because the I2C master is able to access the slave buffer. The application
* can directly access it as well. Note that this is an application-level task
* to ensure the buffer content integrity.
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_master_wr Master Write operation
********************************************************************************
* This operation starts with sending a base address that is one
* or two bytes, depending on the sub-address size configuration. This base
* address is retained and will be used for later read operations. Following
* the base address, there is a sequence of bytes written into the buffer
* starting from the base address location. The buffer index is incremented
* for each written byte, but this does not affect the base address that is
* retained. The length of a write operation is limited by the maximum buffer
* read/write region size.\n
* When a master attempts to write outside the read/write region or past the
* end of the buffer, the last byte is NACKed.
*
* \image html scb_ezi2c_write.png
*
********************************************************************************
* \subsection group_scb_ezi2c_master_rd Master Read operation
********************************************************************************
* This operation always starts from the base address set by the most
* recent write operation. The buffer index is incremented for each read byte.
* Two sequential read operations start from the same base address no matter
* how many bytes are read. The length of a read operation is not limited by
* the maximum size of the data buffer. The EZI2C slave returns 0xFF bytes
* if the read operation passes the end of the buffer.\n
* Typically, a read operation requires the base address to be updated before
* starting the read. In this case, the write and read operations must be
* combined together.
*
* \image html scb_ezi2c_read.png
*
* The I2C master may use the ReStart or Stop/Start conditions to combine the
* operations. The write operation sets only the base address and the following
* read operation will start from the new base address. In cases where the base
* address remains the same, there is no need for a write operation.
* \image html scb_ezi2c_set_ba_read.png
*
********************************************************************************
* \section group_scb_ezi2c_lp Low Power Support
********************************************************************************
* The EZI2C slave provides the callback functions to handle power mode
* transition. The callback \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_DeepSleepCallback must be called
* during execution of \ref Cy_SysPm_CpuEnterDeepSleep;
* \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_HibernateCallback must be called during execution of
* \ref Cy_SysPm_SystemEnterHibernate. To trigger the callback execution, the
* callback must be registered before calling the power mode transition function.
* Refer to  \ref group_syspm driver for more information about power mode
* transitions and callback registration.
*
* The EZI2C configured to support two addresses can wakeup the device on
* address match to NACK not supported address. This happens because the
* hardware address-match-logic uses address bit masking to support to two
* addresses. The address mask defines which bits in the address are treated
* as non-significant while performing an address match. One non-significant
* bit results in two matching addresses; two bits will match 4 and so on.
* If the two addresses differ by more than a single bit, then the extra
* addresses that will pass the hardware match and wakeup the device from
* Deep Sleep mode. Then firmware address matching will to generate a NAK.
* Due to this reason, it is preferable to select a secondary address that
* is different from the primary by one bit. The address mask in this case
* makes one bit non-significant.
* For example:
* * Primary address = 0x24 and secondary address = 0x34, only one bit differs.
*   Only the two addresses are treated as matching by the hardware.
* * Primary address = 0x24 and secondary address = 0x30, two bits differ.
*   Four addresses are treated as matching by the hardware: 0x24, 0x34, 0x20
*   and 0x30. Firmware is required to ACK only the primary and secondary
*   addresses 0x24 and 0x30 and NAK all others 0x20 and 0x34.
*
* \note
* Only applicable for <b>rev-08 of the CY8CKIT-062-BLE</b>.
* For proper operation, when the EZI2C slave is configured to be a wakeup
* source from Deep Sleep mode, the \ref Cy_SCB_EZI2C_DeepSleepCallback must
* be copied and modified. Refer to the function description to get the details.
