/** @file
 *  Allows thread safe access to the WHD WiFi Driver (WHD) hardware bus
 *
 *  This file provides functions which allow multiple threads to use the WHD hardware bus (SDIO or SPI)
 *  This is achieved by having a single thread (the "WHD Thread") which queues messages to be sent, sending
 *  them sequentially, as well as receiving messages as they arrive.
 *
 *  Messages to be sent come from the @ref whd_sdpcm_send_common function in whd_sdpcm.c .  The messages already
 *  contain SDPCM headers, but not any bus headers (GSPI), and are passed to the whd_thread_send_data function.
 *  This function can be called from any thread.
 *
 *  Messages are received by way of a callback supplied by in SDPCM.c - whd_sdpcm_process_rx_packet
 *  Received messages are delivered in the context of the WHD Thread, so the callback function needs to avoid blocking.
 *
 *  It is also possible to use these functions without any operating system, by periodically calling the whd_thread_send_one_packet,
 *  @ref whd_thread_receive_one_packet or @ref whd_thread_poll_all functions
 *
