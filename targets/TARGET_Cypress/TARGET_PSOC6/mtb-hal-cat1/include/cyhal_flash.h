* Provides a high level interface for interacting with the Cypress Flash memory.
* This interface abstracts out the chip specific details. If any chip specific
* functionality is necessary, or performance is critical the low level functions
* can be used directly.

* \{
* High level interface to the internal flash memory.
*
* Flash memory provides non-volatile storage for user firmware, user configuration
* data, and bulk data storage.
*
* This driver allows data to be read from and written to flash. It also provides the
* ability to obtain information about the address and characteristics of the flash
* block(s) contained on the device. During flash write time, the device should not be
* reset (including XRES pin, software reset, and watchdog) or unexpected changes may
* be made to portions of the flash. Also, the low-voltage detect circuits should be
* configured to generate an interrupt instead of a reset.
*
* \note A Read while Write violation may occur for some devices when a flash Read
* operation is initiated in the same or neighboring flash sector where the flash
* Write, Erase, or Program operation is working. Refer the the device datasheet
* for more  information. This violation may cause a HardFault exception. To avoid
* the Read while Write violation, the user must carefully split the Read and Write
* operations on flash sectors which are not neighboring, considering all cores in
* a multi-processor device. You may edit the linker script to place the code into
* neighboring sectors. For example, use sectors number 0 and 1 for code and sectors
* 2 and 3 for data storage.
*
* \section features Features
* * Flash operations are performed on a per-sector basis
* * Supports blocking or partially blocking erase, program and write
* \section code_snippet Code Snippets
* \subsection subsection_flash_use_case_1 Snippet 1: Discovering flash characteristics
* Following code snippet demonstrates how to discover flash characteristics. Refer \ref
* cyhal_flash_info_t for more information.
* \snippet hal_flash.c snippet_cyhal_flash_get_flash_info
*
* \subsection subsection_flash_use_case_2 Snippet 2: Blocking Flash Write Operation
* Following code snippet demonstrates blocking flash write.
* It uses a constant array with a size equaling the size of one flash row. This
* array is placed at an address in flash such that it occupies one complete flash row.
* It uses blocking flash write operation which blocks the caller until the write is
* completed. It then verifies the flash data by comparing the flash data with the
* written data.
* \snippet hal_flash.c flag_snippet_cyhal_flash_blocking_mode_flashwrite
* \note It is recommended to declare the flash array as global variable.
*
* \subsection subsection_flash_use_case_3 Snippet 3: Non-blocking Flash Write Operation using polling
* Following code snippet implements the non-blocking flash write using polling to
* complete the flash write operation. It uses a constant array with a size equaling
* the size of one flash row. This array is placed at an address in flash such that it
* occupies one complete flash row. It uses a polling method to complete the flash
* write operation. It then verifies the flash data by comparing the flash data with
* the written data.
* \snippet hal_flash.c flag_snippet_cyhal_flash_partially_blocking_mode_polling_flashwrite
* \note It is recommended to declare the flash array as global variable.
