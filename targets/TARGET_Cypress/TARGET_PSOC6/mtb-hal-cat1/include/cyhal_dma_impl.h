/** \addtogroup group_hal_impl_dma DMA (Direct Memory Access)
 * \ingroup group_hal_impl
 * \{
 * DW (DataWire) is one of two DMA hardware implementations for CAT1 (PSoC 6).
 * DW is designed for low latency memory to peripheral or peripheral to memory
 * transfers but can also perform memory to memory transfers and peripheral to
 * peripheral transfers.
 *
 * DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) is the second of two DMA hardware
 * implementations for CAT1 (PSoC 6). It is also the implementation that is
 * found on CAT2 (PMG/PSoC 4) devices. DMAC is designed with high memory
 * bandwidth for large memory to memory transfers but can perform peripheral
 * to memory, memory to peripheral, and peripheral to peripheral transfers.
 *
 * Which DMA type is used is dependent on the exact hardware and number of DMA
 * channels already in use. This implementation will attempt to use DMAC first
 * for memory to memory transfers and Datawire otherwise but either type may be
 * used.
 *
 * \section group_hal_impl_dma_interconnect Interconnect
 * For both DW and DMAC each channel has a single input and a single output
 * trigger available. The input, when triggered, initiates a DMA transfer of
 * the configured type (note that this also affects the type transferred by the
 * SW triggering). For output, a trigger is generated when a DMA transfer of
 * the configured type is completed. For DW and DMAC neither input nor output
 * triggers can be disabled completely but the signals do not, of course, have
 * to be connected through the interconnect.
