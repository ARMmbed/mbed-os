* \ingroup group_hal
* \{
* High level interface for interacting with the analog to digital converter (ADC).
*
* \section cyhal_adc_features Features
* Each ADC instance supports one or more selectable channels, each
* of which can perform conversions on a different pin.
* See the device datasheet for details about which pins support ADC conversion.
*
* Both single-ended and differential channels are supported. The values returned
* by the read API are relative to the ADC's voltage range, which is device specific.
* See the BSP documentation for details.
*
* \section cyhal_adc_quickstart Quickstart
* Call \ref cyhal_adc_init to initialize an ADC instance by providing the ADC
* object (<b>obj</b>), input pin (<b>pin</b>) and clock (<b>clk</b>).<br> The input
* pin argument is just to signify which ADC instance to initialize. It does not
* actually reserve the pin or create an ADC channel for it. The clock parameter can
* be left NULL to use an available clock resource with a default frequency.<br>
* Use \ref cyhal_adc_channel_init_diff to initialize one or more channels associated
* with that instance.<br>
* Use \ref cyhal_adc_read for reading the results.<br>
* See \ref subsection_adc_snippet_1.
*
* \note \ref cyhal_adc_read_u16 always returns a 16 bit value in the range
* 0x0000-0xFFFF. If the underlying hardware does not support 16 bit resolution the
* value is scaled linearly to cover the full 16 bits.
*
* \section subsection_adc_snippets Code snippets
* \note Error checking is omitted for clarity
* \subsection subsection_adc_snippet_1 Snippet 1: Simple ADC initialization and reading conversion result
* The following snippet initializes an ADC and one channel.
* One ADC conversion result is returned corresponding to the input at the specified
* pin.
* \snippet hal_adc.c snippet_cyhal_adc_simple_init
*
* \subsection subsection_adc_snippet_2 Snippet 2: Multi-channel ADC initialization and reading conversion result
* The following snippet initializes an ADC with one single-ended channel and one differential channel
* \snippet hal_adc.c snippet_cyhal_adc_multi_init
*
* \subsection subsection_adc_snippet_3 Snippet 3: Asynchronously read multiple channels
*  The following snippet illustrates how to asynchronously read multiple scans of multiple channels.
* \snippet hal_adc.c snippet_cyhal_adc_async_read
*
* \subsection subsection_adc_snippet_4 Snippet 4: Continuous scanning
*  This snippet shows how to run the ADC in continuous mode and process results as each scan completes.
