* \ingroup group_hal
* \{
* Interface for getting and changing clock configuration.
*
* The clock driver is a single API designed to allow reading and configuring
* any clock in the system. The driver works the same to configure System clocks
* as it does for Peripheral clocks. It supports both a readonly mode where any
* number of items can get information about the clock. Alternatively, each
* clock can have a single owner that is able to adjust the configuration of the
* clock.
*
* This driver supports source clocks, clock dividers, and clock signal muxes.
* All clock objects support the get() functions. Only some clocks support
* setting specific attributes. Use the \ref cyhal_clock_get_features() function
* to determine which features are settable for a specific clock. Calling a set()
* function on a clock that does not support it will return an error.
*
* This driver makes no assumptions about how the device is currently configured.
* It can be used from a completely unconfigured system (eg: device just booted)
* to a fully pre-configured (eg: setup by the Device Configurator). The drivers
* query and modify the actual state of the hardware, there is no caching or
* remembering of state. To maximize portability of code, it is often convenient
* to place all system clock configuration into a Board Support Package (BSP) so
* the main application code is flexible and can port between devices.
*
* \ref cyhal_clock_get allows for getting access to a specific clock object.
* This clock reference can be used to call any of the get() functions at any
* time. If a clock needs to be modified, either \ref cyhal_clock_allocate or
* \ref cyhal_clock_init must be called to obtain a lock on the clock object
* and to ensure that nothing else in the application is currently using it or
* assuming its configuration is stable. If exclusive control of a clock is no
* longer needed \ref cyhal_clock_free can be called to release it. This will
* remove the lock allowing something else in the system to potentially modify
* its state.
*
* \ref cyhal_clock_init and \ref cyhal_clock_allocate are very similar. They both
* reserve a clock object that can then be modified. The difference between them
* is the argument that is passed in. \ref cyhal_clock_init takes a specific
* instance that it will attemt to reserve. \ref cyhal_clock_allocate takes in a
* type of clock that it will attempt to find a free instance for and reserve that.
*
* \note After calling \ref cyhal_clock_free the clock object can still be used to
* call any of the get() functions just as is possible from the instance returned
* by \ref cyhal_clock_get.
*
* \note A clock only needs to be allocated ( \ref cyhal_clock_allocate ) or
* initialized ( \ref cyhal_clock_init ) if its configuration needs to be changed
* by calling one of the set() functions.
*
* \note While the API is generic, the specific clock resource instances
* (\ref cyhal_resource_inst_t) are device specific. See the implementation
* specific sections for more details on what clocks and hardware resources are
* available.
*
* \section section_clock_features Features
* * Queryable clock features
* * Configurable clock enablement
* * Configurable clock frequency/divider
* * Configurable clock sources
* * Reserve or share clock objects
*
* \section section_clock_quickstart Quick Start
*
* See \ref subsection_clock_snippet_1 for a code snippet that shows how to reserve
* and configure a clock object.
*
* \section section_clock_snippets Code snippets
* \note Error handling code has been intentionally left out of snippets to highlight API usage.
*
* \subsection subsection_clock_snippet_1 Snippet 1: Simple clock read only access
* The following snippet shows how get details about a clock if there is no need to adjust any of its
* settings (e.g. read only access). This does not require initializing a clock object.
* \snippet hal_clock.c snippet_cyhal_clock_simple_access
*
* \subsection subsection_clock_snippet_2 Snippet 2: Simple clock reservation and configuration
* The following snippet initializes a clock object, updates its frequency then enables it.
* \snippet hal_clock.c snippet_cyhal_clock_simple_init
*
* \subsection subsection_clock_snippet_3 Snippet 3: Clock allocation and reuse
* The following snippet shows how a clock can be allocated and reused for multiple peripheral instances.
* \snippet hal_clock.c snippet_cyhal_clock_simple_allocate
*
* \subsection subsection_clock_snippet_4 Snippet 4: Change clock source
* The following snippet shows how a to change the source of a clock.
* \snippet hal_clock.c snippet_cyhal_clock_change_source
*
* \subsection subsection_clock_snippet_5 Snippet 5: System initialization
