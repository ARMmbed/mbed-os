* \brief
* Provides variables necessary to inform programming tools how to program the
* attached serial flash memory. The variables used here must be placed at
* specific locations in order to be detected and used by programming tools
* to know that there is an attached memory and its characteristics. Uses the
* configuration provided as part of BSP.

* \{
* In addition to the APIs for reading and writting to memory at runtime, this library also 
* provides support for informing programming tools about the external memory so it can be
* be written at the same time as internal flash. This support can be enabled by defining 
* CY_ENABLE_XIP_PROGRAM while building the application. With this define in place, code
* will be generated in the .cy_sflash_user_data & .cy_toc_part2 sections. These locations 
* can be read by programming tools (eg: Cypress Programmer, OpenOCD, pyOCD) to know that 
* there is a memory device attached and how to program it.
