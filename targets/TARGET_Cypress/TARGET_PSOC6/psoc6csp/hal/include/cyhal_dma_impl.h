 * DW (DataWire) is one of two DMA hardware implementations for PSOC6. DW is
 * designed for low latency memory to peripheral or peripheral to memory
 * transfers but can also perform memory to memory transfers and peripheral to
 * peripheral transfers.
 *
 * DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller) is the second of two DMA hardware
 * implementations for PSOC6. DMAC is designed with high memory bandwidth for
 * large memory to memory transfers but can perform peripheral to memory,
 * memory to peripheral, and peripheral to peripheral transfers.
 *
 * Which DMA type is used is dependent on the exact hardware and number of DMA
 * channels already in use. This implementation will attempt to use DMAC first
 * for memory to memory transfers and Datawire otherwise but either type may be
 * used. */
