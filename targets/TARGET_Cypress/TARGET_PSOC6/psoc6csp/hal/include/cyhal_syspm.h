/**
* \addtogroup group_hal_syspm System Power Management
* \ingroup group_hal
* \{
* Interface for changing power states and restricting when they are allowed.
*
* Power management is handled both at a system level and at a peripheral driver
* level. The system wide API (this) allows the user to interact with the product
* as a whole. Additionally, each peripheral keeps track of what its state is and
* whether it can safely move to a new state while still maintaining any current
* operations.
*
* At the System level, the APIs are intended to allow the application to specify
* exactly what is happening. It can request changes to both the MCU Power State
* as well as the System Wide Power State. There are three supported MCU Power
* States:
* * Active - This is the normal operating state of the MCU
* * Sleep - In this state the MCU is no longer running. It can be woken up again
* from an interrupt. This state is reached by calling \ref cyhal_syspm_sleep.
* * Deep Sleep - In this state the MCU is no longer running. It can only be woken
* up by select interrupts. This state is reached by calling \ref
* cyhal_syspm_deepsleep.
* <p>Additionally, there are three supported system states:
* * Normal (\ref CYHAL_SYSPM_SYSTEM_NORMAL) - This is a normal operating state
* for the device. This is exposed by \ref cyhal_syspm_set_system_state.
* * Low (\ref CYHAL_SYSPM_SYSTEM_LOW) - This is a lower power operating state
* that may be supported by the device. This state often imposes specific
* requirements on clock speeds and voltage levels. See the device specific
* documentation for any device specific requirements for this mode, or whether
* it is even supported. If the device supports this mode, it is exposed by
* \ref cyhal_syspm_set_system_state.
* * Hibernate - This is the lowest available power state. In this state most of
* the chip is powered down. It has a very limited number of wakeup sources, and
* may require the device to reboot in order to come back up. It can be accessed
* by calling \ref cyhal_syspm_hibernate.

* Any time a power state transition is requested a series of callbacks are invoked.
* This allows peripherals, or other parts of the application, to confirm they are
* not currently doing something that would not work in the requested power state.
* HAL Peripheral drivers automatically register these callbacks when they are
* initialized. The application also has the option to register a callback
* function(s) to be called on requested state transitions by callling \ref
* cyhal_syspm_register_callback. If registered, the application level callbacks
* are invoked first. This gives the application a chance stop any peripherals, if
* appropriate, to ensure the power transition can actually happen. Alternatively
* it can directly reject the transition. Each callback registered can specify
* the exact set of states ( \ref cyhal_syspm_callback_state_t ) that it should
* be called for. Each callback is invoked multiple times as part of the transition
* process as defined by \ref cyhal_syspm_callback_mode_t.
*
* At any point the code can lock the ability to enter deep sleep by calling \ref
* cyhal_syspm_lock_deepsleep. This should be done in critical blocks that need to
* continue remain active. When the critical work is complete, and the lock is no
* longer needed, it can be released by calling \ref cyhal_syspm_unlock_deepsleep.
* The lock is a counter with a max count of USHRT_MAX. It must be locked/unlocked
* an equal number of times before the device is actually able to enter deep sleep.
*
* All peripherals are expected to operate in the default Active/Normal power
* state. Some peripherals (primarily analog) can operate in lower power states as
* well. These drivers will operate in all power states that the hardware supports.
*
* When power transitions are requested each type of peripheral has a default
* behavior. Peripherals that can continue to operate in the requested power mode
* do not interfere. Peripherals that are not currently active allow the transition,
* but make sure they restore their state if needed for when the device comes back.
* Peripherals that are active and cannot continue to work in the requested power
* state will block the transition.
*
* \note The power management functionality available depends on the availability
* of the features in the hardware. For detailed information about exactly what is
* supported on each device, refer to the Device Datasheet or Technical Reference
* Manual (TRM).

* \section section_syspm_features Features
* This driver provides control over multiple different types of power management
* and when those transitions are allowed:
* * Change CPU Power State: APIs to allow changing the current CPU state into
* one of the lower power CPU states (SLEEP, DEEPSLEEP)
* * Change System Power State: An API allows for changing the system wide power
* state between one of states (NORMAL, LOW)
* - Hibernate: An API that allows to set the hibernate
* wakeup source and set the system state to Hibernate.
* * General Purpose Power State Transition Callback: APIs allow for
* registering/unregistering a callback function to be notified when various power
* state transitions happen. If registered, the application can do anything necessary
* at power transitions. It can even prevent the transition if need-be.
* * Peripheral Specific Power State Transition Callback: APIs allow for
* registering/unregistering a callback function to be called when a peripheral with
* a CUSTOM power mode strategy exists and a power mode transition is requested.
* This allows the application to customize when it is OK for the peripheral to enter
* a low power state.
* - Lock DeepSleep: APIs to prevent/allow the CPU from going to deep sleep. This
* is a convenience API rather than needing to implement a full Transition Callback
* handler.
*
* \section section_syspm_quickstart Quick Start
*
* Unlike most HAL drivers this does not require initializing an instance object. The
* APIs provided here can be called at anytime. See the snippets below for examples
* of how to use this driver.
*
* \section section_syspm_snippets Code Snippets
*
* \subsection subsection_syspm_snippet_1 Snippet 1: Simple deep sleep locking
* The following snippet shows how to use the deep sleep locking APIs to restrict
* when the device can enter deep sleep. In between the lock/unlock calls any
* attempt to change power modes will automatically be canceled.
