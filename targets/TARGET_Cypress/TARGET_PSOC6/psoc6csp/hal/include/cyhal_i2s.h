* Provides a high level interface for interacting with the Cypress I2S.
* This interface abstracts out the chip specific details. If any chip specific
* functionality is necessary, or performance is critical the low level functions
* can be used directly.

* \{
* High level interface for interacting with the Inter-IC Sound (I2S).
*
* The I2S protocol is a asynchronous serial interface protocol. This driver supports
* both transmit and receive modes of operation. The communication frequency, sample rate,
* word size, and channel size can all be configured.
*
* \section section_i2s_features Features
*
* * Transmit and receive functionality
* * Configurable data rates
* * Configurable channel and word size
* * Configurable interrupt and callback assignment from I2S events - \ref cyhal_i2s_event_t
*
* \section section_i2s_quickstart Quick Start
* Initialize an I2S instance using the \ref cyhal_i2s_init and provide the transmit (tx) and/or receive (rx) pins.<br>
* See \ref subsection_i2s_snippet_1 for example initialization as transmit or receive.
* \note The clock parameter (const \ref cyhal_clock_t *clk) is optional and can be set
* to NULL to generate and use an available clock resource with a default frequency.
*
* The sclk frequency is determined as `sclk = sample_rate_hz * channel_length * 2`
* (multiplying by 2 for 2 channels - left and right). The input clock must be a multiple of this sclk
* frequency; see the implementation specific documentation for the supported multipliers.
*
* It is possible to use either only TX functionality, only RX functionality, or both RX and TX functionality at the same time.
* If RX and TX are both in use, the same sample rate, channel length, word length, sclk frequency will be used for both.
