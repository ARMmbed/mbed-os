-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v5.1.2...v5.1.3)


## [v5.1.2](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v5.1.2)

- Compiler warning cleanups.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v5.1.1...v5.1.2)


## [v5.1.1](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v5.1.1)

- Delay the random initialization of message id to a later phase and not during init() so there is enough time
  for system to complete the rest of the initialization.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v5.1.0...v5.1.1)


## [v5.1.0](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v5.1.0)

- Introduce SN_COAP_REDUCE_BLOCKWISE_HEAP_FOOTPRINT configuration flag. 
  Flag is disabled by default to keep the backward compatibility in place.
  If flag is enabled, application must NOT free the payload when it gets the COAP_STATUS_PARSER_BLOCKWISE_MSG_RECEIVED status.
  And application must call sn_coap_protocol_block_remove() instead.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0)

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v5.0.0)

- Reduce heap footprint by storing only single block when receiving a blockwise message.
    * User is now responsible of freeing the data by calling sn_coap_protocol_block_remove() and must not free the payload separately.
- Bug fix: Request blockwise transfer if incoming payload length is too large and when it comes without block indication. 

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.8.1...v5.0.0)

## [v4.8.1](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.8.1)
- Store ACK's also into duplicate info list.
- ROM size optimization. Flash size has gone down ~1100 bytes.

**Closed issues:**
-  IOTCLT-3592 - Client does not handle Duplicate ACK messages during blockwise registration correctly

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.8.0...v4.8.1)

## [v4.8.0](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.8.0) 
- Make `sn_coap_protocol_linked_list_duplication_info_remove` API to public. User might want to delete some messages from the duplicate list.
- Enable support for unified client configuration.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.7.4...v4.8.0)

## [v4.7.4](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.7.4) 

- Remove dependency to yotta tool
- Do not remove stored (GET) blockwise message when EMPTY ACK received
    When non piggybacked response mode is used original GET request must not be removed from the stored message list.
    Message is needed for building the next (GET) blockwise message.
- Move definitions to sn_config.h

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.7.3...v4.7.4)

## [v4.7.3](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.7.3) 

- Do not store EMPTY response to blockwise list
    An Empty message only contains the 4-byte header so it does not require any blockwise operations.
    This will fix unneseccary message sending timeouts which leads mbed cloud client to do unnecessary
    reconnections which increases the network traffic.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.7.2...v4.7.3)

## [v4.7.2](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.7.2) 

- Fix handling of duplicate blockwise ACK's
    CoAP data buffer was not added into duplication info store when creating response for blockwise request.
    This leads to case where whole bootstrap flow just timeouts if received any duplicate messages during blockwise operation.
    Fixes error: IOTCLT-3188 - UDP connection fails for lost ACK sending

- Remove error trace when building reset message without options
    This makes it possible to build the reset message without allocating option or getting error message.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.7.1...v4.7.2)

## [v4.7.1](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.7.1) 

- Fix CoAP stored blockwise message release and list continue
	Add re-scan routine goto if message is caused user callback
	This will fix hard fault when blockwise message sending timeouts. This happens cause same list is manipulated through rx callback.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.7.0...v4.7.1)

## [v4.7.0](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.7.0) 

- Add function that can be used to clear the received blockwise payloads for example in the case of a connection error.
- Silence compiler warning when CoAP duplicate detection is enabled.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.6.3...v4.7.0)

## [v4.6.3](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.6.3) 

 - Bug fix: Remove timed out blockwise message from resend queue. If blockwise message was timed out message was still kept in the resend queue which causes unnecessary reconnections on client side.
 - Documentation: Document all the available macros.

-[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/compare/v4.6.2...v4.6.3)

## [v4.6.2](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.6.2) 

Do not clear block2 in subsequent block request.

When sending a request with block2 option, eg. indicating need
for response to be blockwised, copy the block2 option from the
sent_blockwise list item so that the block2 option will be added
to all requests. This fixes an issue where previously the block2
was only sent for the first blockwise request and not for the
subsequent ones, including the last request. This made the response
not follow the request block2 option.

## [v4.6.1](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/releases/tag/v4.6.1)

**Closed issues:**
 - IIOTCLT-2769 - mbed-coap: extra response received after registration

Added own flag to enable blockwise support, without setting default blockwise
payload size. This allows to receive blockwise messages while still sending
without blockwise.

Fix CoAP request blockwise response handling
When request is sent, response can have blockwise option set. All requests must
be stored to the linked list.
