/**
 * The base class for controlling the FPGA CI Test Shield
 *
 * This is the primary interface to the FPGA CI Test Shield. It contains
 * all the code to communicate with the FPGA. It also provides high level
 * helper functions, such as functions to setup pin multiplexing, to
 * select the currently active peripheral and to perform software updates.
 *
 * Subclasses can inherit from this class and provide further functionality,
 * such as the ability to test SPI.
 *
 * @note Synchronization level: Not protected
 *
 * Example of how to toggle Arduino pin D6 from the FPGA cI Test Shield:
 * @code
 * #include "mbed.h"
 * #include "MbedTester.h"
 *
 * const PinList *form_factor = pinmap_ff_default_pins();
 * const PinList *restricted = pinmap_restricted_pins();
 * MbedTester tester(form_factor, restricted);
 *
 * int main() {
 *     // Reset the FPGA CI Test Shield to put it into a known state
 *     tester.reset();
 *
 *     // Select the GPIO peripheral
 *     tester.select_peripheral(MbedTester::PeripheralGPIO);
 *
 *     // Map D6 to LogicalPinGPIO0
 *     tester.pin_map_set(D6, MbedTester::LogicalPinGPIO0);
 *
 *     // Toggle pin D6
 *     int toggle = 0;
 *     while (1) {
 *         tester.gpio_write(MbedTester::LogicalPinGPIO0, toggle, true);
 *         ThisThread::sleep_for(500);
 *         toggle = !toggle;
