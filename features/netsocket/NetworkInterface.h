    /** Return the default network interface.
     *
     * Returns the default network interface, as determined by JSON option
     * target.network-default-interface-type or other overrides.
     *
     * The type of the interface returned can be tested by calling ethInterface(),
     * wifiInterface(), meshInterface(), cellularInterface(), emacInterface() and checking
     * for NULL pointers.
     *
     * The default behavior is to return the default interface for the
     * interface type specified by target.network-default-interface-type. Targets
     * should set this in their targets.json to guide default selection,
     * and applications may override.
     *
     * The interface returned should be already configured for use such that its
     * connect() method works with no parameters. For connection types needing
     * configuration, settings should normally be obtained from JSON - the
     * settings for the core types are under the "nsapi" JSON config tree.
     *
     * The list of possible settings for default interface type is open-ended,
     * as is the number of possible providers. Core providers are:
     *
     * * ETHERNET: EthernetInterface, using default EMAC and OnboardNetworkStack
     * * MESH: ThreadInterface or LoWPANNDInterface, using default NanostackRfPhy
     * * CELLULAR: OnboardModemInterface
     * * WIFI: None - always provided by a specific class
     *
     * Specific drivers may be activated by other settings of the
     * default-network-interface-type configuration.  This will depend on the
     * target and the driver. For example a board may have its default setting
     * as "AUTO" which causes it to autodetect an Ethernet cable. This should
     * be described in the target's documentation.
     *
     * An application can override all target settings by implementing
     * NetworkInterface::get_default_instance() themselves - the default
     * definition is weak, and calls get_target_default_instance().
