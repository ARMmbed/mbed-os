 @file UsefulBuf.h

 The goal of this code is to make buffer and pointer manipulation
 easier and safer when working with binary data.

 You use the UsefulBuf, UsefulOutBuf and UsefulInputBuf
 structures to represent buffers rather than ad hoc pointers and lengths.

 With these it will often be possible to write code that does little or no
 direct pointer manipulation for copying and formatting data. For example
 the QCBOR encoder was rewritten using these and has no direct pointer
 manipulation.

 While it is true that object code using these functions will be a little
 larger and slower than a white-knuckle clever use of pointers might be, but
 not by that much or enough to have an affect for most use cases. For
 security-oriented code this is highly worthwhile. Clarity, simplicity,
 reviewability and are more important.

 There are some extra sanity and double checks in this code to help catch
 coding errors and simple memory corruption. They are helpful, but not a
 substitute for proper code review, input validation and such.

 This code consists of a lot of inline functions and a few that are not.
 It should not generate very much object code, especially with the
 optimizer turned up to -Os or -O3. The idea is that the inline
 functions are easier to review and understand and the optimizer does
 the work of making the code small.

/**
 UsefulBufC and UsefulBuf are simple data structures to hold a pointer and
 length for a binary data.  In C99 this data structure can be passed on the
 stack making a lot of code cleaner than carrying around a pointer and
 length as two parameters.

 This is also conducive to secure code practice as the lengths are
 always carried with the pointer and the convention for handling a
 pointer and a length is clear.

 While it might be possible to write buffer and pointer code more
 efficiently in some use cases, the thought is that unless there is an
 extreme need for performance (e.g., you are building a gigabit-per-second
 IP router), it is probably better to have cleaner code you can be most
 certain about the security of.

 The non-const UsefulBuf is usually used to refer a buffer to be filled in.
 The length is the size of the buffer.

 The const UsefulBufC is usually used to refer to some data that has been
 filled in. The length is amount of valid data pointed to.

 A common use is to pass a UsefulBuf to a function, the function fills it
 in, the function returns a UsefulBufC. The pointer is the same in both.

 A UsefulBuf is NULL, it has no value, when the ptr in it is NULL.

 There are utility functions for the following:
  - Checking for UsefulBufs that are NULL, empty or both
  - Copying, copying with offset, copying head or tail
  - Comparing and finding substrings
  - Initializating
  - Create initialized const UsefulBufC from compiler literals
  - Create initialized const UsefulBufC from NULL-terminated string
  - Make an empty UsefulBuf on the stack

 See also UsefulOutBuf. It is a richer structure that has both the size of
 the valid data and the size of the buffer.

 UsefulBuf is only 16 or 8 bytes on a 64- or 32-bit machine so it can go
 on the stack and be a function parameter or return value.

 UsefulBuf is kind of like the Useful Pot Pooh gave Eeyore on his birthday.
 Eeyore's balloon fits beautifully, "it goes in and out like anything".

/**
 UsefulOutBuf is a structure and functions (an object) that are good
 for serializing data into a buffer such as is often done with network
 protocols or data written to files.

 The main idea is that all the pointer manipulation for adding data is
 done by UsefulOutBuf functions so the caller doesn't have to do any.
 All the pointer manipulation is centralized here.  This code will
 have been reviewed and written carefully so it spares the caller of
 much of this work and results in much safer code with much less work.

 The functions to add data to the output buffer always check the
 length and will never write off the end of the output buffer. If an
 attempt to add data that will not fit is made, an internal error flag
 will be set and further attempts to add data will not do anything.

 Basically, if you initialized with the correct buffer, there is no
 way to ever write off the end of that buffer when calling the Add
 and Insert functions here.

 The functions to add data do not return an error. The working model
 is that the caller just makes all the calls to add data without any
 error checking on each one. The error is instead checked after all the
 data is added when the result is to be used.  This makes the caller's
 code cleaner.

 There is a utility function to get the error status anytime along the
 way if the caller wants. There are functions to see how much room is
 left and see if some data will fit too, but their use is generally
 not necessary.

 The general call flow is like this:

    - Initialize the UsefulOutBuf with the buffer that is to have the
      data added.  The caller allocates the buffer.  It can be heap
      or stack or shared memory (or other).

    - Make calls to add data to the output buffer. Insert and append
      are both supported. The append and insert calls will never write
      off the end of the buffer.

    - When all data is added, check the error status to make sure
      everything fit.

    - Get the resulting serialized data either as a UsefulBuf (a
      pointer and length) or have it copied to another buffer.

 UsefulOutBuf can be initialized with just a buffer length by passing
 NULL as the pointer to the output buffer. This is useful if you want
 to go through the whole serialization process to either see if it
 will fit into a given buffer or compute the size of the buffer
 needed. Pass a very large buffer size when calling Init, if you want
 just to compute the size.

 Some inexpensive simple sanity checks are performed before every data
 addition to guard against use of an uninitialized or corrupted
 UsefulOutBuf.

 This has been used to create a CBOR encoder. The CBOR encoder has
 almost no pointer manipulation in it, is much easier to read, and
 easier to review.

 A UsefulOutBuf is 27 bytes or 15 bytes on 64- or 32-bit machines so it
 can go on the stack or be a C99 function parameter.

 achieved by inserting at the end of the valid data. This can be
 retrieved by calling UsefulOutBuf_GetEndPosition().

 When insertion is performed, the bytes between the insertion point and
 the end of data previously added to the output buffer is slid to the
 right to make room for the new data.

 Overlapping buffers are OK. NewData can point to data in the output
 buffer.

 If an error occurs an error state is set in the UsefulOutBuf. No
 error is returned.  All subsequent attempts to add data will do

/**
 UsefulInputBuf is the counterpart to UsefulOutBuf and is for parsing
 data read or received.  Initialize it with the data
 from the network and its length. Then  use the functions
 here to get the various data types out of it. It maintains a position
 for getting the next item. This means you don't have to track a
 pointer as you get each object. UsefulInputBuf does that for you and
 makes sure it never goes off the end of the buffer.  The QCBOR
 implementation parser makes use of this for all its pointer math and
 length checking.

 UsefulInputBuf also maintains an internal error state so you do not have
 to. Once data has been requested off the end of the buffer, it goes
 into an error state. You can keep calling functions to get more data
 but they will either return 0 or NULL. As long as you don't
 dereference the NULL, you can wait until all data items have been
 fetched before checking for the error and this can simplify your
 code.

 The integer and float parsing expects network byte order (big endian).
 Network byte order is what is used by TCP/IP, CBOR and most internet
 protocols.

 Lots of inlining is used to keep code size down. The code optimizer,
 particularly with the -Os, also reduces code size a lot. The only
 non-inline code is UsefulInputBuf_GetBytes() which is less than 100
 bytes so use of UsefulInputBuf doesn't add much code for all the messy
 hard-to-get right issues with parsing in C that is solves.

 The parse context size is:
   64-bit machine: 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 (5 bytes padding to align) = 32 bytes
   32-bit machine: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 (1 byte padding to align) = 16 bytes
