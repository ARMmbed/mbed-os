 Public function -- see UsefulBuf.h

 The core of UsefulOutBuf -- put some bytes in the buffer without writing off the end of it.

 Code Reviewers: THIS FUNCTION DOES POINTER MATH

 This function inserts the source buffer, NewData, into the destination buffer, me->UB.ptr.

 Destination is represented as:
   me->UB.ptr -- start of the buffer
   me->UB.len -- size of the buffer UB.ptr
   me->data_len -- length of value data in UB

 Source is data:
   NewData.ptr -- start of source buffer
   NewData.len -- length of source buffer

 Insertion point:
   uInsertionPos.

 Steps:

 0. Corruption checks on UsefulOutBuf

 1. Figure out if the new data will fit or not

 2. Is insertion position in the range of valid data?

 3. If insertion point is not at the end, slide data to the right of the insertion point to the right

 4. Put the new data in at the insertion position.

   }

   /* 0. Sanity check the UsefulOutBuf structure */
   // A "counter measure". If magic number is not the right number it
   // probably means me was not initialized or it was corrupted. Attackers
   // can defeat this, but it is a hurdle and does good with very
   // little code.
   if(me->magic != USEFUL_OUT_BUF_MAGIC) {
      me->err = 1;
      return;  // Magic number is wrong due to uninitalization or corrption
   }

   // Make sure valid data is less than buffer size. This would only occur
   // if there was corruption of me, but it is also part of the checks to
   // be sure there is no pointer arithmatic under/overflow.
   if(me->data_len > me->UB.len) {  // Check #1
      me->err = 1;
      return; // Offset of valid data is off the end of the UsefulOutBuf due to uninitialization or corruption
   }

   /* 1. Will it fit? */
   // WillItFit() is the same as: NewData.len <= (me->size - me->data_len)
   // Check #1 makes sure subtraction in RoomLeft will not wrap around

      // The new data will not fit into the the buffer.

   // This, with Check #1, also confirms that uInsertionPos <= me->data_len
   if(uInsertionPos > me->data_len) { // Check #3
      // Off the end of the valid data in the buffer.
      me->err = 1;
      return;
   }

   /* 3. Slide existing data to the right */
   uint8_t *pSourceOfMove       = ((uint8_t *)me->UB.ptr) + uInsertionPos; // PtrMath #1
   size_t   uNumBytesToMove     = me->data_len - uInsertionPos; // PtrMath #2

      // To know memmove won't go off end of destination, see PtrMath #4
      memmove(pDestinationOfMove, pSourceOfMove, uNumBytesToMove);

/*
 Rationale that describes why the above pointer math is safe

 PtrMath #1 will never wrap around over because
    Check #0 in UsefulOutBuf_Init makes sure me->UB.ptr + me->UB.len doesn't wrap
    Check #1 makes sure me->data_len is less than me->UB.len
    Check #3 makes sure uInsertionPos is less than me->data_len

 PtrMath #2 will never wrap around under because
    Check #3 makes sure uInsertionPos is less than me->data_len

 PtrMath #3 will never wrap around over because   todo
    PtrMath #1 is checked resulting in pSourceOfMove being between me->UB.ptr and a maximum valid ptr
    Check #2 that NewData.len will fit

 PtrMath #4 will never wrap under because
    Calculation for extent or memmove is uRoomInDestination  = me->UB.len - (uInsertionPos + NewData.len)
    Check #3 makes sure uInsertionPos is less than me->data_len
    Check #3 allows Check #2 to be refactored as NewData.Len > (me->size - uInsertionPos)
    This algebraically rearranges to me->size > uInsertionPos + NewData.len

 PtrMath #5 is exactly the same as PtrMath #1

 PtrMath #6 will never wrap under because
    Calculation for extent of memove is uRoomInDestination = me->UB.len - uInsertionPos;
    Check #1 makes sure me->data_len is less than me->size
    Check #3 makes sure uInsertionPos is less than me->data_len
