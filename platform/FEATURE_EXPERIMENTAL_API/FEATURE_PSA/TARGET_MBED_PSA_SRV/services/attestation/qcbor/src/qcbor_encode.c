 CBOR's two nesting types, arrays and maps, are tracked here. There is a
 limit of QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING to the number of arrays and maps
 that can be nested in one encoding so the encoding context stays
 small enough to fit on the stack.

 When an array / map is opened, pCurrentNesting points to the element
 in pArrays that records the type, start position and accumluates a
 count of the number of items added. When closed the start position is
 used to go back and fill in the type and number of items in the array
 / map.

 Encoded output be just items like ints and strings that are
 not part of any array / map. That is, the first thing encoded
 does not have to be an array or a map.

/*
 Error tracking plan -- Errors are tracked internally and not returned
 until Finish is called. The CBOR errors are in me->uError.
 UsefulOutBuf also tracks whether the buffer is full or not in its
 context.  Once either of these errors is set they are never
 cleared. Only QCBOREncode_Init() resets them. Or said another way, they must
 never be cleared or we'll tell the caller all is good when it is not.

 Only one error code is reported by QCBOREncode_Finish() even if there are
 multiple errors. The last one set wins. The caller might have to fix
 one error to reveal the next one they have to fix.  This is OK.

 The buffer full error tracked by UsefulBuf is only pulled out of
 UsefulBuf in Finish() so it is the one that usually wins.  UsefulBuf
 will never go off the end of the buffer even if it is called again
 and again when full.

 It is really tempting to not check for overflow on the count in the
 number of items in an array. It would save a lot of code, it is
 extremely unlikely that any one will every put 65,000 items in an
 array, and the only bad thing that would happen is the CBOR would be
 bogus.

 Since this does not parse any input, you could in theory remove all
 error checks in this code if you knew the caller called it
 correctly. Maybe someday CDDL or some such language will be able to
 generate the code to call this and the calling code would always be
 correct. This could also automatically size some of the data
 structures like array/map nesting resulting in some stack memory
 savings.

 Errors returned here fall into two categories:

 Sizes
   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE -- Encoded output exceeded UINT32_MAX
   QCBOR_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL -- output buffer too small

   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_NESTING_TOO_DEEP -- Array/map nesting > QCBOR_MAX_ARRAY_NESTING1
   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_TOO_LONG -- Too many things added to an array/map

 Nesting constructed incorrectly
   QCBOR_ERR_TOO_MANY_CLOSES -- more close calls than opens
   QCBOR_ERR_CLOSE_MISMATCH -- Type of close does not match open
   QCBOR_ERR_ARRAY_OR_MAP_STILL_OPEN -- Finish called without enough closes

/*
 All CBOR data items have a type and an "argument". The argument is
 either the value of the item for integer types, the length of the
 content for string, byte, array and map types, a tag for major type
 6, and has several uses for major type 7.

 This function encodes the type and the argument. There are several
 encodings for the argument depending on how large it is and how it is
 used.

 Every encoding of the type and argument has at least one byte, the
 "initial byte".

 The top three bits of the initial byte are the major type for the
 CBOR data item.  The eight major types defined by the standard are
 defined as CBOR_MAJOR_TYPE_xxxx in qcbor.h.

 The remaining five bits, known as "additional information", and
 possibly more bytes encode the argument. If the argument is less than
 24, then it is encoded entirely in the five bits. This is neat
 because it allows you to encode an entire CBOR data item in 1 byte
 for many values and types (integers 0-23, true, false, and tags).

 If the argument is larger than 24, then it is encoded in 1,2,4 or 8
 additional bytes, with the number of these bytes indicated by the
 values of the 5 bits 24, 25, 25 and 27.

 It is possible to encode a particular argument in many ways with this
 representation.  This implementation always uses the smallest
 possible representation. This conforms with CBOR preferred encoding.

 This function inserts them into the output buffer at the specified
 position. AppendEncodedTypeAndNumber() appends to the end.

 This function takes care of converting to network byte order.

 This function is also used to insert floats and doubles. Before this
 function is called the float or double must be copied into a
 uint64_t. That is how they are passed in. They are then converted to
 network byte order correctly. The uMinLen param makes sure that even

 if all the digits of a half, float or double are 0 it is still
 correctly encoded in 2, 4 or 8 bytes.

    This code does endian conversion without hton or knowing the
    endianness of the machine using masks and shifts. This avoids the
    dependency on hton and the mess of figuring out how to find the
    machine's endianness.

    This is a good efficient implementation on little-endian machines.
    A faster and small implementation is possible on big-endian
    machines because CBOR/network byte order is big endian. However
    big endian machines are uncommon.

    On x86, it is about 200 bytes instead of 500 bytes for the more
    formal unoptimized code.

    This also does the CBOR preferred shortest encoding for integers
    and is called to do endian conversion for floats.

 Total is about 1.1KB

 _QCBOREncode_CloseMapOrArray is larger because it has a lot
 of nesting tracking to do and much of Nesting_ inlines
 into it. It probably can't be reduced much.

 If the error returned by Nesting_Increment() can be ignored
 because the limit is so high and the consequence of exceeding
 is proved to be inconsequential, then a lot of if(me->uError)
 instance can be removed, saving some code.
