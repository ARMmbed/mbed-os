/** \defgroup attributes Key attributes

/** The type of a structure containing key attributes.
 *
 * This is an opaque structure that can represent the metadata of a key
 * object. Metadata that can be stored in attributes includes:
 * - The location of the key in storage, indicated by its key identifier
 *   and its lifetime.
 * - The key's policy, comprising usage flags and a specification of
 *   the permitted algorithm(s).
 * - Information about the key itself: the key type and its size.
 * - Implementations may define additional attributes.
 *
 * The actual key material is not considered an attribute of a key.
 * Key attributes do not contain information that is generally considered
 * highly confidential.
 *
 * An attribute structure can be a simple data structure where each function
 * `psa_set_key_xxx` sets a field and the corresponding function
 * `psa_get_key_xxx` retrieves the value of the corresponding field.
 * However, implementations may report values that are equivalent to the
 * original one, but have a different encoding. For example, an
 * implementation may use a more compact representation for types where
 * many bit-patterns are invalid or not supported, and store all values
 * that it does not support as a special marker value. In such an
 * implementation, after setting an invalid value, the corresponding
 * get function returns an invalid value which may not be the one that
 * was originally stored.
 *
 * An attribute structure may contain references to auxiliary resources,
 * for example pointers to allocated memory or indirect references to
 * pre-calculated values. In order to free such resources, the application
 * must call psa_reset_key_attributes(). As an exception, calling
 * psa_reset_key_attributes() on an attribute structure is optional if
 * the structure has only been modified by the following functions
 * since it was initialized or last reset with psa_reset_key_attributes():
 * - psa_set_key_id()
 * - psa_set_key_lifetime()
 * - psa_set_key_type()
 * - psa_set_key_bits()
 * - psa_set_key_usage_flags()
 * - psa_set_key_algorithm()
 *
 * Before calling any function on a key attribute structure, the application
 * must initialize it by any of the following means:
 * - Set the structure to all-bits-zero, for example:
 *   \code
 *   psa_key_attributes_t attributes;
 *   memset(&attributes, 0, sizeof(attributes));
 *   \endcode
 * - Initialize the structure to logical zero values, for example:
 *   \code
 *   psa_key_attributes_t attributes = {0};
 *   \endcode
 * - Initialize the structure to the initializer #PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT,
 *   for example:
 *   \code
 *   psa_key_attributes_t attributes = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;
 *   \endcode
 * - Assign the result of the function psa_key_attributes_init()
 *   to the structure, for example:
 *   \code
 *   psa_key_attributes_t attributes;
 *   attributes = psa_key_attributes_init();
 *   \endcode
 *
 * A freshly initialized attribute structure contains the following
 * values:
 *
 * - lifetime: #PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE.
 * - key identifier: 0 (which is not a valid key identifier).
 * - type: \c 0 (meaning that the type is unspecified).
 * - key size: \c 0 (meaning that the size is unspecified).
 * - usage flags: \c 0 (which allows no usage except exporting a public key).
 * - algorithm: \c 0 (which allows no cryptographic usage, but allows
 *   exporting).
 *
 * A typical sequence to create a key is as follows:
 * -# Create and initialize an attribute structure.
 * -# If the key is persistent, call psa_set_key_id().
 *    Also call psa_set_key_lifetime() to place the key in a non-default
 *    location.
 * -# Set the key policy with psa_set_key_usage_flags() and
 *    psa_set_key_algorithm().
 * -# Set the key type with psa_set_key_type().
 *    Skip this step if copying an existing key with psa_copy_key().
 * -# When generating a random key with psa_generate_key() or deriving a key
 *    with psa_key_derivation_output_key(), set the desired key size with
 *    psa_set_key_bits().
 * -# Call a key creation function: psa_import_key(), psa_generate_key(),
 *    psa_key_derivation_output_key() or psa_copy_key(). This function reads
 *    the attribute structure, creates a key with these attributes, and
 *    outputs a handle to the newly created key.
 * -# The attribute structure is now no longer necessary.
 *    You may call psa_reset_key_attributes(), although this is optional
 *    with the workflow presented here because the attributes currently
 *    defined in this specification do not require any additional resources
 *    beyond the structure itself.
 *
 * A typical sequence to query a key's attributes is as follows:
 * -# Call psa_get_key_attributes().
 * -# Call `psa_get_key_xxx` functions to retrieve the attribute(s) that
 *    you are interested in.
 * -# Call psa_reset_key_attributes() to free any resources that may be
 *    used by the attribute structure.
 *
 * Once a key has been created, it is impossible to change its attributes.
