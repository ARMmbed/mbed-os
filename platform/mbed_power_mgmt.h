/** Sleep manager API
 * The sleep manager provides API to automatically select sleep mode.
 *
 * There are two sleep modes:
 * - sleep
 * - deepsleep
 *
 * Use locking/unlocking deepsleep for drivers that depend on features that
 * are not allowed (=disabled) during the deepsleep. For instance, high frequency
 * clocks.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 *
 * void driver::handler()
 * {
 *     if (_sensor.get_event()) {
 *         // any event - we are finished, unlock the deepsleep
 *         sleep_manager_unlock_deep_sleep();
 *         _callback();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * int driver::measure(event_t event, callback_t& callback)
 * {
 *      _callback = callback;
 *      sleep_manager_lock_deep_sleep();
 *      // start async transaction, we are waiting for an event
 *      return _sensor.start(event, callback);
 * }
 * @endcode
