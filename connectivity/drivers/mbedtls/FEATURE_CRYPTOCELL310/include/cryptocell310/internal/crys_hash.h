@brief This file contains all of the enums and definitions
that are used for the CRYS HASH APIs, as well as the APIs themselves.
@defgroup crys_hash CryptoCell HASH APIs
@{
@ingroup cryptocell_api


This product supports the following HASH algorithms (or modes, according to product):
<ul><li> CRYS_HASH_MD5 (producing 16 byte output).</li>
<li> CRYS_HASH_SHA1 (producing 20 byte output).</li>
<li> CRYS_HASH_SHA224 (producing 28 byte output).</li>
<li> CRYS_HASH_SHA256 (producing 32 byte output).</li>
<li> CRYS_HASH_SHA384 (producing 48 byte output).</li>
<li> CRYS_HASH_SHA512 (producing 64 byte output).</li></ul>

HASH calculation can be performed in either of the following two modes of operation:
<ul><li> Integrated operation - Processes all data in a single function call. This flow is applicable when all data is available prior to the
	 cryptographic operation.</li>
<li> Block operation - Processes a subset of the data buffers, and is called multiple times in a sequence. This flow is applicable when the
     next data buffer becomes available only during/after processing of the current data buffer.</li></ul>

The following is a typical HASH Block operation flow:
<ol><li> ::CRYS_HASH_Init - this function initializes the HASH machine on the CRYS level by setting the context pointer that is used on the entire
	 HASH operation.</li>
<li> ::CRYS_HASH_Update - this function runs a HASH operation on a block of data allocated by the user. This function may be called as many times
     as required.</li>
<li> ::CRYS_HASH_Finish - this function ends the HASH operation. It returns the digest result and clears the context.</li></ol>
