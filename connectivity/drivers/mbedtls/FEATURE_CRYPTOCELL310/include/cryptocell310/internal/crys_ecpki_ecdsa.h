@brief This function performs an ECDSA sign operation in integrated form.

\note
Using of HASH functions with HASH size greater than EC modulus size, is not recommended!.
Algorithm according [ANS X9.62] standard.

The message data may be either a non-hashed data or a digest of a hash function.
For a non-hashed data, the message data will be hashed using the hash function indicated by ::CRYS_ECPKI_HASH_OpMode_t.
For a digest, ::CRYS_ECPKI_HASH_OpMode_t should indicate the hash function that the message data was created by, and it will not be hashed.

@return CRYS_OK on success.
@return A non-zero value on failure as defined crys_ecpki_error.h, crys_hash_error.h or crys_rnd_error.h.
