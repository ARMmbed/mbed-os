/** Allocates a packet buffer
 *
 *  Implemented in the port layer interface which is specific to the
 *  buffering scheme in use.
 *  Attempts to allocate a packet buffer of the size requested. It can do this
 *  by allocating a pre-existing packet from a pool, using a static buffer,
 *  or by dynamically allocating memory. The method of allocation does not
 *  concern WHD, however it must match the way the network stack expects packet
 *  buffers to be allocated.
 *
 *  @param buffer     : A pointer which receives the allocated packet buffer handle
 *  @param direction  : Indicates transmit/receive direction that the packet buffer is
 *                      used for. This may be needed if tx/rx pools are separate.
 *  @param size       : The number of bytes to allocate.
 *  @param timeout_ms : Maximum period to block for available buffer
 *
 *  @return           : WHD_SUCCESS or error code

 *  This function is used by WHD to indicate that it no longer requires
 *  a packet buffer. The buffer can then be released back into a pool for
 *  reuse, or the dynamically allocated memory can be freed, according to
 *  how the packet was allocated.
 *  Returns void since WHD cannot do anything about failures

 *  @param buffer    : The handle of the packet buffer to be released
 *  @param direction : Indicates transmit/receive direction that the packet buffer has

 *  Since packet buffers usually need to be created with space at the front for additional headers,

 *  add headers to transmit packets, and so that the network stack does not see the internal WHD
 *  headers on received packets.

 *                             to a newly allocated packet buffer which has been daisy chained to
 *                             the front of the given one. This would be the case if the given packet
 *                             buffer  didn't have enough space at the front.
 *  @param add_remove_amount : This is the number of bytes to move the current pointer of the packet
 *                             buffer - a negative value increases the space for headers at the front
 *                             of the packet, a positive value decreases the space.
