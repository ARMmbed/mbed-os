/**
 * Representation of a GattServer attribute.
 *
 * Attributes are the building block of GATT servers: services are attributes,
 * characteristics are groups of attributes and characteristic descriptors are
 * attributes, too.
 *
 * @par Typed values
 *
 * Attributes are typed values composed of a type and its associated value. The
 * attribute type identifies the attribute purpose. A UUID read by the client
 * during the discovery of the GATT server models the attribute type. The value of the
 * attribute is an array of bytes; its length may be fixed or variable.
 *
 * As an example, a primary service is declared by an attribute with the type
 * 0x2800, and the value of the attribute is the UUID of the service.
 *
 * @par Attribute Access
 *
 * The GATT server is an array of attributes in which a unique index identifies
 * each of the attributes within the array. That index is called the attribute
 * handle, and clients use it to access to attributes within the server.
 *
 * @note Attributes do not contain information related to their permissions,
 * grouping or semantic. Higher level specifications define these concepts.
