 * Representation of a GATT service discovered.

 * The discovery procedure discovers GATT Services are discovered on distant
 * GATT servers, which can be initiated by calling
 * GattClient::launchServiceDiscovery() or GattClient::discoverServices(). The
 * discovery process passes instances of this class to the callback handling
 * service discovered.
 *
 * Discovered services are characterized by the UUID of the service discovered
 * and the range of the GATT attributes belonging to the service.
 *
 * The UUID can be queried by calling getUUID() while the begining of the
 * attribute range can be obtained through getStartHandle() and the end of the
 * attribute range with a call to getEndHandle().
 *
 * The characteristics composing the service may be discovered by the function
 * GattClient::launchServiceDiscovery().
