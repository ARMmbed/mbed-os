/**
 * BLE Battery service.
 *
 * @par purpose
 *
 * The battery service exposes the charge level of the battery of the device.
 * This information is exposed as a percentage from 0% to 100%; a value of 0%
 * represents a fully discharged battery, and a value of 100% represents a
 * fully charged battery.
 *
 * Clients can read the current charge level and subscribe to server initiated
 * updates of the charge level. The server delivers these updates to the subscribed
 * client in a notification packet.
 *
 * The subscription mechanism is useful to save power; it avoids unecessary data
 * traffic between the client and the server, which may be induced by polling the
 * battery level characteristic value.
 *
 * @par usage
 *
 * When this class is instantiated, it adds a battery service in the GattServer.
 *
 * The application code can use the function updateBatteryLevel() to update the
 * charge level that the service exposes and to notify the subscribed client that the
 * value changed.
 *
 * @note You can find specification of the battery service here:
 * https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt
 *
 * @attention Multiple instances of this battery service are not supported.
