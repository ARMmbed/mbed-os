/**
 * Function like object adapter over freestanding and member functions.
 *
 * Freestanding and member functions are two distinct types in C++. One is
 * not convertible into the other, and the call syntax between the two is
 * different even if conceptually they are similar: Both primitives can be
 * copied, called and produce a result.
 *
 * To solve incompatibilities, this class adapts freestanding and member functions
 * to a common interface. The interface chosen is similar to the freestanding
 * function pointers interface:
 *    - Copyable.
 *    - Nullable.
 *    - Callable.
 *
 * This class also offers a mechanism to chain other instances to it. When an
 * instance is called, all the instances being part of the chain are called.
 *
 * @attention freestanding or member function adapted must accept a single
 * argument, and this argument is a pointer to ContextType. Adapted
 * primitives do not return anything.
 *
 * @tparam ContextType Type of the argument pointee.
