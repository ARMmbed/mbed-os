/**
 * Construct and operates a GATT server.
 *
 * A Gatt server is a collection of GattService; these services contain
 * characteristics that a peer connected to the device may read or write.
 * These characteristics may also emit updates to subscribed clients when their
 * values change.
 *
 * @p Server Layout
 *
 * Application code can add a GattService object to the server with the help of
 * the function addService(). That function registers all the GattCharacteristic
 * enclosed in the service, as well as all the characteristics descriptors (see
 * GattAttribute) these characteristics contain. Service registration assigns
 * a unique handle to the various attributes being part of the service; this
 * handle should be used for subsequent read or write of these components.
 *
 * There are no primitives defined to remove a single service; however, a call to
 * the function reset() removes all services previously registered in the
 * GattServer.
 *
 * @p Characteristic and attributes access
 *
 * Values of the characteristic and the characteristic descriptor present in the
 * GattServer must be accessed through the handle assigned to them when the service
 * has been registered; the GattServer class offers several flavors of read()
 * and write() functions that retrieve or mutate an attribute value.
 *
 * Application code can query if a client has subscribed to a given
 * characteristic's value update by invoking the function areUpdatesEnabled().
 *
 * @p Events
 *
 * The GattServer allows application code to register several event handlers that
 * can be used to monitor client and server activities:
 *   - onDataSent(): Register an event handler that is called when a
 *     characteristic value update has been sent to a client.
 *   - onDataWriten(): Register an event handler that is called when a
 *     client has written an attribute of the server.
 *   - onDataRead(): Register an event handler that is called when a
 *     client has read an attribute of the server.
 *   - onUpdatesEnabled: Register an event handler that is called when a
 *     client subscribes to updates of a characteristic.
 *   - onUpdatesDisabled: Register an event handler that is called when a
 *     client unsubscribes from updates of a characteristic.
 *   - onConfimationReceived: Register an event handler that is called
 *     when a client acknowledges a characteristic value notification.
 *
 * @note The term characteristic value update is used to represent
 * Characteristic Value Notification and Characteristic Value Indication when
 * the nature of the server initiated is not relevant.
