# Mbed cellular connectivity

This is the Github repo for Mbed cellular connectivity:

    framework/
        API         Application Programming Interface for cellular connectivity
        AT          AT implementation based on 3GPP TS 27.007 specification
        common      Common and utility sources
        device      Implementation of cellular device and state machine
        targets     Vendor specific cellular module adaptations

**Note:** Application developers should use only the `API` folder.

## Known limitations

**Please note that this is a first release of Cellular framework and is subject to further development in future.**

## Supported modules

You can find currently supported cellular modules in the `framework/targets/` folder, where we also add support for new cellular modules.

## Cellular configuration

You can change cellular defaults in the `mbed_lib.json` configuration file.

## Debug traces

You can define the debug tracing level in the `mbed_app.json` configuration file:

```
"target_overrides": {
    "*": {
        "mbed-trace.enable": true,
        "platform.stdio-convert-newlines": true,
        "platform.stdio-baud-rate": 115200,
        "platform.default-serial-baud-rate": 115200
    }
},
"config": {
    "trace-level": {
        "help": "Options are TRACE_LEVEL_ERROR,TRACE_LEVEL_WARN,TRACE_LEVEL_INFO,TRACE_LEVEL_DEBUG",
        "macro_name": "MBED_TRACE_MAX_LEVEL",
        "value": "TRACE_LEVEL_INFO"
    }
}
```

## Greentea tests

Cellular connectivity can be tested with generic Mbed OS netsocket and network interface tests found in Mbed OS root `TESTS` directory. For more information, see `TESTS/netsocket/README.md` and `TESTS/network/interface/README.md`.

## Unit tests

Cellular unit tests are in Mbed OS root `UNITTESTS/connectivity/cellular`.

## Dependency with netsocket

If you create a .mbedignore file with
```
connectivity/cellular*
connectivity/drivers/cellular*
```

MBED_CONF_CELLULAR_PRESENT will not be set
