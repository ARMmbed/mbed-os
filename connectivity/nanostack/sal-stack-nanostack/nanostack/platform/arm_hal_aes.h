 * some hardware acceleration, which should be made available through this API.
 *
 * If no hardware acceleration is available, the API can be easily hooked up to
 * an external software library such as mbed TLS.
 *
 * To simplify porting, the API is used single-threaded, so that no special care
 * is needed to maintain global context or state in the hardware accelerator.
