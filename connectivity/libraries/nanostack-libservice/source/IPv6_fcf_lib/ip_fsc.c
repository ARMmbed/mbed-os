/** \brief Compute IPv6 checksum
 *
 * Compute an IPv6 checksum, given fields of an IPv6 pseudoheader and payload.

 * This returns the 1's-complement of the checksum, as required when
 * generating the checksum for transmission. The result can be 0x0000;
 * for UDP (only) this must be transformed to 0xFFFF to distinguish from
 * a packet with no checksum.
 *
 * To check a packet, this function will return 0 when run on a
 * packet with a valid checksum. Checksums should be checked like this rather
 * than setting the checksum field to zero and comparing generated checksum with
 * the original value - this would fail in the case the received packet had
 * checksum 0xFFFF.
