/*
 * Nanostack NVM API.
 *
 * After NVM initialization (platform_nvm_init(...)) a user can:
 * -create key to the NVM by using method platform_nvm_key_create(...)
 * -write data to the NVM by using method platform_nvm_write(...)
 * -read data from the NVM by using method platform_nvm_read(...)
 * -delete the created key by using platform_nvm_key_delete(...)
 * -store changed data to the underlying backing store by using method platform_nvm_flush(...).
 *
 * This NVM API is asynchronous. If API function returns PLATFORM_NVM_OK then provided callback function will be
 * called once operation is completed. Callback function carries status parameter that indicates status of the
 * operation. If platform API function returns error code then callback will not be called. A new operation can not
 * be started until the previous operation has completed.
