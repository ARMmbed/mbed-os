Network Socket test plan
========================

This is a test plan for the Mbed OS Socket API. This describes all test cases and their intended behaviors. When an API document is not clear, use this as a reference for implementing correct behavior.

**NOTE:** Because testing is a moving target, this test plan might define more test cases than Mbed OS implements. Refer to [test case priorities](#test-case-priorities) for a list of test cases that the target must pass to be compliant with the Mbed OS socket API.

Target API
----------

The target for this plan is to test:

-   [Socket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/connectivity/netsocket/Socket.h).
-   [UDPSocket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/connectivity/netsocket/UDPSocket.h).
-   [TCPSocket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/connectivity/netsocket/TCPSocket.h).
-   [TLSSocket](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/connectivity/netsocket/TLSSocket.h).
-   [DNS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/blob/master/connectivity/netsocket/DNS.h).

Please see the [Network Socket documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/network-socket.html) for reference.

Tools to use
----------------

-   Mbed OS.
-   Standard Mbed OS development tools as described in the [Mbed OS tools overview](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tools/index.html).
-   Test server.

These test cases themselves do not require any special tooling, other than the test server described in "Test environment" chapter.

Test environment
----------------

As a general guideline, network connectivity with public Internet access is required. This satisfies Socket tests, but specific connectivity methods might require some extra configuration or devices within the network.

The test environment consist of DUTs, network connection and the test server. Arm provides a public test server, but it can be installed locally as well, if an isolated test environment is required.

### Public test server

Address: `echo.mbedcloudtesting.com`.

Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are available from a public DNS service:

```.sh
$ host echo.mbedcloudtesting.com
echo.mbedcloudtesting.com has address 52.215.34.155
echo.mbedcloudtesting.com has IPv6 address 2a05:d018:21f:3800:8584:60f8:bc9f:e614
```

**Open services in the test server**

-   Echo protocol, [RFC 862](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc862) is enabled on both TCP and UDP on port 7. Port 2007 for TLS
-   Discard protocol, [RFC 863](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc863) is enabled in both TCP and UDP on port 9. Port 2009 for TLS.
-   Character generator protocol, [RFC 864](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc864) is enabled in both TCP and UDP on port 19. Port 2019 for TLS. The output pattern follows the proposed example pattern in RFC.
-   Daytime protocol, [RFC 867](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc867) in both TCP and UDP on port 13. Port 2013 for TLS.
-   Time protocol, [RFC 868](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc868) in both TCP and UDP on port 37.

Configure the firewall to allow this traffic to access the test server.

**Example configuration for Debian/Ubuntu Linux**

These services are available on many operating systems, and installing them is out of scope of this document. Below is an example of how to install these services into a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution using standard Inet Daemon:

```.sh
$ sudo apt install inetutils-inetd
$ nano /etc/inetd.conf
```

Enable following services from /etc/inetd.conf:

```
#:INTERNAL: Internal services
discard     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
discard     dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
echo        stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
echo        dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
chargen     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
chargen     dgram   udp6    wait    root    internal
daytime     stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
time        stream  tcp6    nowait  root    internal
```

Below is an example of how to install these services in TLS version into a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution using Stunnel4 Daemon:

```.sh
$ sudo apt install stunnel4
$ nano /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf
```

Enable following services from /etc/inetd.conf:

```

```

Get, update and install certificate files by certbot (Provided by Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>).

-   Install lighthttpd server:

   ```.sh
   $ sudo apt-get install lighttpd
   $ sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/*
   $ sudo echo "<html><body><h1>Empty</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
   $ sudo echo "</body></html>" >> /var/www/html/index.html
   $ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/index.html
   $ sudo systemctl restart lighttpd.service
   ```

-   Install and set up certbot:

   ```.sh
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
   $ sudo apt-get update
   $ sudo apt-get install certbot
   $ sudo certbot certonly
   $ sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/html -d <test_server_url>
   ```

-   Set test server to renew certificate before expiry.

   ```.sh
   $ sudo echo "SHELL=/bin/sh" > /etc/cron.d/certbot
   $ sudo echo "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin" > /etc/cron.d/certbot
   $ sudo echo "0 */12 * * * root test -x /usr/bin/certbot -a \! -d /run/systemd/system && perl -e 'sleep int(rand(43200))' && certbot -q renew" > /etc/cron.d/certbot
   ```

Where <test_server_url> is the test server URL.

**Testing the connectivity**

You can connect to the test server with an NMAP tool:

```.sh
$ nmap -sT -p7,9,13,37,2007,2009,2013 echo.mbedcloudtesting.com

### Ethernet test environment

![Ethernet](eth_environment.png)

The Ethernet test environment consists of devices, an Ethernet switch and an optional firewall that allows connecting to the Echo server.

### Wi-Fi test environment

![Wi-Fi](wifi_environment.png)

The Wi-Fi test environment is equivalent to the Ethernet test environment, except that the Wi-Fi test environment has two separate access points or one with dual SSID. Connectivity to echo server is required, but it can be hosted locally, as specified in the Ethernet environment.

Test case priorities
--------------------

Please refer to the following table for priorities of test cases. Priorities are labeled as MUST and SHOULD. MUST means this is a requirement and therefore mandatory to pass the test. SHOULD means it is recommended to pass the test if the driver implements the feature in question.

Building test binaries
--------------------------

To test the board and driver, test against the Mbed OS master branch to get the most recent, up-to-date test cases and drivers.

To create a build environment:

```.sh
mbed new network_test
cd network_test
cd mbed-os
git checkout master
cd ..
```

Also, building socket test cases requires a special macro to enable all tests, so create an `mbed_app.json` file with the following content at minimum:

```
{
    "config": {
        "echo-server-addr" : {
            "help" : "IP address of echo server",
            "value" : "\"echo.mbedcloudtesting.com\""
        },
        "echo-server-port" : {
            "help" : "Port of echo server",
            "value" : "7"
        },
        "echo-server-discard-port" : {
            "help" : "Discard port of echo server",
            "value" : "9"
        },
        "echo-server-port-tls" : {
            "help" : "Echo port of echo server",
            "value" : "2007"
        },
        "echo-server-discard-port-tls" : {
            "help" : "Discard port of echo server",
            "value" : "2009"
        }
    }
}
```

Wi-Fi tests require some more configuration, so for Wi-Fi purposes, the `mbed_app.json` might look like this:

```
{
    "config": {
        "wifi-secure-ssid": {
            "help": "WiFi SSID for WPA2 secured network",
            "value": "\"test-network\""

            "value" : "2007"
        },
        "echo-server-discard-port-tls" : {
            "help" : "Discard port of echo server for TLS",

        }
    },

            "nsapi.default-wifi-security": "WPA_WPA2"
        }
    }

```

Cellular tests require some more configuration, so for cellular purposes, the `mbed_app.json` might look like this:
NOTE! These are just typical settings needed for cellular. Actual configuration values depend on used target HW, SIM, modem and network capabilities.

```

Now build the test binaries:

```.sh
mbed test --compile -t <toolchain> -m <target> -n mbed-os-tests-network-*,mbed-os-tests-netsocket*
```

Running tests
-------------

Run this when the device is connected to network, or if the wireless device is near the access point:

```.sh
mbed test -n mbed-os-tests-network-*,mbed-os-tests-netsocket*
```

Test cases for Socket class
---------------------------

These tests are the same as those for UDPSocket and TCPSocket. The Socket class is abstract, so it cannot be instantiated; therefore, these test cases are implemented using both TCPSocket and UDPSocket. Some of these tests are also implemented for the TLSSocket class. In such case, the certificate has to be set for the Socket before calling `open()`, unless specified otherwise in the test's
description.
