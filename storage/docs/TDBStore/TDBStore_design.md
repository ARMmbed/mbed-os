# Introduction

### Overview and background

Tiny Database Storage (TDBStore) is a lightweight module that stores data on flash storage. It is part of of the [KVStore](../KVStore/KVStore_design.md) class family, meaning it supports the get/set interface. It is designed to optimize performance (speed of access), reduce wearing of the flash and minimize storage overhead. It is also resilient to power failures.

### Requirements and assumptions

TDBStore assumes the underlying block device is fully dedicated to it (starting offset 0). If you want to dedicate only a part of the device to TDBStore, use a sliced block device, typically with `SlicingBlockDevice`.

# System architecture and high-level design

## Design basics

TDBStore includes the following design basics:  
- Sequential writes: TDBStore performs all writes sequentially on the physical storage as records, superseding the previous ones for the same key.  
- Memory layout - areas: TDBStore divides the physical storage equally into two areas - active and standby. All writes are made to the end of the active area's free space. When the active area is exhausted, a garbage collection process is invoked, copying only the up to date values of all keys to the standby area, and turning it active.
- RAM table: Indexes all keys in RAM, thus allowing fast access to their records in the physical storage.   

### Sequential writes

All writes occur sequentially on the physical storage as records, superseding the previous ones for the same key. Each data record is written right after the last written one. If a key is updated, a new record with this key is written, overriding the previous value of this key. If a key is deleted, a new record with a "deleted" flag is added.

Writes expect the storage to be erased. However, TDBStore takes the "erase as you go" approach, meaning that when it crosses a sector boundary, it checks whether the next sector is erased. If not, it erases the next sector. This saves time during initialization and garbage collection. 

### Memory layout and areas

![TDBStore Areas](./TDBStore_areas.jpg)

Each key is stored in a separate record on the active area. The first record in the area is the master record. Its main purpose is to hold an area version, protecting you against a case in which there are two valid areas. (This can happen in the extreme cases of power failures.) 

![TDBStore Record](./TDBStore_record.jpg)

A 24-byte header precedes a record key and data. Fields are:

- Magic: a constant value, for quick validity checking.
- Header size: size of header.
- Revision: TDBStore revision (currently 1).
- User flags: Flags received from user. Currently only write once is dealt with (others are ignored).
- Internal flags: Internal TDBStore flags (currently only includes deleted flag).
- Key size: size of key.
- Data size: size of data.
- CRC: a 32-bit CRC, calculated on header (except CRC), key and data.
- Programming size pad: padding to the storage programming size.

### Garbage collection

Garbage collection (GC) is the process of compacting the records stored in the active area to the standby one, by copying only the most recent values of all the keys (without the ones marked as deleted). Then, the standby area becomes the active one and the previously active area is erased (not fully, only its first sector).

GC is invoked in the following cases:

- When the active area is exhausted.
- During initialization, when a corruption is found while scanning the active area. In this case, GC is performed up to the record preceding the corruption.

### Reserved space

The active area includes a fixed and small reserved space. This space is used for a quick storage and extraction of a write-once data (such as the device key). Its size is 32 bytes, aligned up to the underlying block device. Once it is written, nothing can modify it. It is also copied between the areas during garbage collection process.

### RAM table

All keys are indexed in memory using a RAM table. Key names are represented by a 32-bit hash. The table includes the hash (and sorted by it) and the offset to the key record in the block device. This allows both fast searching in the table and a low memory footprint. To keep code simple, the same CRC function used for recored validation is used for hash calculation (because TLS hash calculation is too heavy). 

![TDBStore RAM Table](./TDBStore_ram_table.jpg)

Key names may produce duplicate hash values. This is OK because the hash is only used for fast access to the key, and the key needs to be verified when accessing the storage. If the key doesn't match, move to the next duplicate in the table. 

# Detailed design

TDBStore fully implements the KVStore interface over a block device. Due to the fact it may write to the block device in program units that don't have to match the underlying device program units, it should use a `BufferedBlockDevice` for that purpose.

![TDBStore Class Hierarchy](./TDBStore_class_hierarchy.jpg)

Functionality, as defined by KVStore, includes the following:

- Initialization and reset.
- Core actions: get, set and remove.
- Incremental set actions.
- Iterator actions.

    // Initialization and reset
    virtual int init();
    virtual int deinit();
    virtual int reset();

    // Core API
    virtual int set(const char *key, const void *buffer, size_t size, uint32_t create_flags);
    virtual int get(const char *key, void *buffer, size_t buffer_size, size_t *actual_size = NULL, size_t offset = 0);
    virtual int get_info(const char *key, info_t *info);
    virtual int remove(const char *key);
 
    // Incremental set API

    // Key iterator
    virtual int iterator_open(iterator_t *it, const char *prefix = NULL);
    virtual int iterator_next(iterator_t it, char *key, size_t key_size);
    virtual int iterator_close(iterator_t it);
    
    // Reserved space APIs
    virtual int reserved_space_set(void *data);

    bool _is_initialized;
    int _active_area;
    
    // Important internal functions
    
    // find record offset in flash
    int find_record(const char *key, uint32_t *hash, bd_size_t *bd_offset, size_t ram_table_ind);
    
    // garbage collection
    int garbage_collection(const char *key, const void *buffer, size_t size, uint32_t create_flags);
}
```

# Usage scenarios and examples

### Standard use of the class

The following example code shows standard use of the TDBStore class:

**Standard usage example**

```C++
// Underlying block device. Here, SPI Flash is fully used.
// One can use SlicingBlockDevice if we want a partition.
SPIFBlockDevice bd(PTE2, PTE4, PTE1, PTE5);

// Instantiate tdbstore with our block device
TDBStore tdbstore(&bd);

int res;

// Initialize tdbstore
res = tdbstore.init();

// Add "Key1"
const char *val1 = "Value of key 1";
const char *val2 = "Updated value of key 1";
res = tdbstore.set("Key1", val1, sizeof(val1), 0);
// Update value of "Key1"
res = tdbstore.set("Key1", val2, sizeof(val2), 0);

uint_8 value[32];
size_t actual_size;
// Get value of "Key1". Value should return the updated value.
res = tdbstore.get("Key1", value, sizeof(value), &actual_size);

// Remove "Key1"
res = tdbstore.remove("Key1");

// Incremental write, if need to generate large data with a small buffer
const int data_size = 1024;
char buf[8];

KVSTore::set_handle_t handle;
res = tdbstore.set_start(&handle, "Key2", data_size, 0);
for (int i = 0; i < data_size / sizeof(buf); i++) {
	memset(buf, i, sizeof(buf));
	res = tdbstore.set_add_data(handle, buf, sizeof(buf));
}
res = tdbstore.set_finalize(handle);

// Iterate over all keys starting with "Key"
res = 0;
KVSTore::iterator_t it;
tdbstore.iterator_open(&it, "Key*");
char key[KVSTore::KV_MAX_KEY_LENGTH];
while (!res) {
    res = tdbstore.iterator_next(&it, key, sizeof(key));
}
res = tdbstore.iterator_close(&it);

// Deinitialize TDBStore
res = tdbstore.deinit();
```

### Open issues

- Need to figure a way to prevent mutex abuse in incremental set APIs.
